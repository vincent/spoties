# Spoti.es - Event Staffing Platform

Spoti.es is an event staffing platform designed to simplify the complexities of event organization, especially when managing multiple locations.
Think of it as Google Forms, but with locations as a core component, making it easy to coordinate staff and resources across various venues.

Spoti.es is built upon [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev).
